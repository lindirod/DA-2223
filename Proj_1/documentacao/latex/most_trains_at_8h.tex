Calculate the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously arrive at a station. 

This function calculates the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously arrive at a given station based on the provided stations and segments information. Building the connections map takes O(\+M) time, where M is the number of segments. Checking if the input station exists in the connections map takes O(1) time on average. Calculating the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously arrive at the input station involves iterating over the connected stations and segments, and for each segment, finding the maximum capacity. This takes O(\+N $\ast$ S) time, where N is the number of connected stations and S is the number of segments. Finally, iterating over the segment\+\_\+max\+\_\+trains map and summing up the maximum capacities takes O(\+N) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the most\+Trains\+At function is O(\+N $\ast$ S), where N is the number of connected stations and S is the number of segments.
