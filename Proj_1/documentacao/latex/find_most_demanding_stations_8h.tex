Finds the pairs of stations with the most amount of trains needed. 

This function takes a vector of \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_station}{Station}} objects and a vector of \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_segment}{Segment}} objects as input. It calculates the maximum capacity (total capacity) between each pair of stations based on the segments connecting them, and then sorts the station pairs in descending order of maximum capacity. Finally, it prints the pairs of stations with their maximum capacity. The time complexity of the find\+Most\+Demanding\+Stations function is\+: O(n$^\wedge$3 log n) where n is the number of stations. This is because of the nested loops and sorting operation in the function. The first loop has an O(n) time complexity since it iterates through the stations vector, which contains n stations. The second loop iterates over the stations vector as well, but it does so starting from the subsequent station. As a consequence, the first station receives n-\/1 iterations, the second station receives n-\/2 iterations, and so on, for a total of (n-\/1) + (n-\/2) +... + 1 iterations. O(n$^\wedge$2) is the overall time complexity as a result. The third loop, which can take m iterations to complete, iterates over the segments vector and has an O(m) time complexity. An if-\/statement that has an O(1) time complexity is contained inside the third loop and checks for matching station names. The station\+Pairs vector, which contains n(n-\/1)/2 pairs, is then given the sort function to run on it. O(n$^\wedge$2 log n) time complexity is required to sort n(n-\/1)/2 pairs.

Since the most time-\/consuming operations in the function take up the most time, the find\+Most\+Demanding\+Stations function\textquotesingle{}s overall time complexity is O(n$^\wedge$3 log n).
