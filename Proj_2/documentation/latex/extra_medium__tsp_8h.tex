This function performs the triangular approximation algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using triangular approximation. This function solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the triangular approximation algorithm. It loads the edge graph from the specified CSV file, extracts the number of nodes from the filename, and applies the triangular approximation algorithm to find the tour.
